Hi, there!

In this project, I am exploring the new Next.js App Router. The main goal is to have a blog wall and a page to display the post content. I am using the Dev.to API (https://developers.forem.com/api/v1) to feed "real world" data into the project. I am constraining this app to read-only, meaning that it won't be possible to create blog posts or comments onto Dev.to.

*This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).*

## Checklist

### Blog Wall

- [ ] Posts list section (Server-Side Rendered)
- [ ] Tags list sidebar (Client-Side Rendered)
- [ ] Search header (Client-Side Rendered)

### Post Details

- [ ] Content markdown render (Server-Side Rendered)
- [ ] Comment section (Client-Side Rendered)

## Running the app locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run local
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Ending Note

I'm always eager to learn more. So, if you have any suggestions feel free to submit a Pull Request with the recommended change (please include an explanation and/or description as well!).
